Extracts tests from comments on functions in coffeescript code.

Names:
  csdt
  robusta-doc-test



Advantages:
  - Much less boilerplate. You don't have to care about require paths and maintaining test suites 
  - No fancy naming. All info you need gets generated automatically.
  - Easy execution. Just point to the file you want to run tests in: `robusta-doc-test src/pkg/file.coffee` - or a directory to run tests from all of its files: `coffee-doc-test src`
  . The `node_modules` directory require
  - Allows testing of unexported members

Sample executions:
- `coffee-doc-test src/pkg/file.coffee` will run all tests from file
- `coffee-doc-test src` will run tests in all files in dir
- `coffee-doc-test src/file.coffee target/tests/file.coffee target/clean-sources/file.coffee` saves the appropriate output
- `coffee-doc-test src target/tests target/clean-sources` saves the appropriate output
